# openbox-themes
A selection of customized openbox themes
I haven't create the themes. I took them from www.box-look.org and modified them a little bit, so that they suit to the Numix- and/or the Arc-GTK-Theme.

Thanks to the original writers of the themes! You have done a great job!

## Usage
Just download the theme you're interested in and copy the folder in ~/.themes. After that you can select the theme with lxappearance or via your rc.xml file.
